# sproutime
A desktop application that tracks application screen time, allows users to set usage goals, and rewards them upon completion.

Traditional app usage limiting solutions often focus solely on restrictions without offering positive reinforcement; our app provides an innovative solution by integrating both.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage
**Basic workflow:** Our app helps you manage screen time positively by letting you set **daily quests** for specific applications. It **automatically tracks usage** in the background, shows your progress, **notifies** you when quests are complete, and visually represents your achievements through **tree growth**. You can also easily **import and export** your quest and app data.

**Example scenarios:**

1. A parent wants their child to spend 1 hour on an educational app each day. They set a quest for this app. The child uses the app, receives a notification upon completion, and sees their virtual tree grow a bit taller, encouraging continued positive habits.

2. A user wants to limit their social media use. They set a daily quest for a social media app. The app tracks their usage, notifies them if they exceed the limit, and allows them to review their usage patterns on the pie chart to adjust their habits.
